During lockdown, having set up my studio in between my kitchen table and back garden, 
I looked at my drawings of Sicily and began to paint. Over the course of the last decade, 
my family and I travelled to Sicily. Here the light is very harsh/ strong, and the 
temperatures soar to 43â„ƒ daily, so it was on our daily trips down the mountain, to swim in the 
Mediterranean Sea, that we would pull over and soak up the vistas, this vista being my favourite. 
It's my way of recording the intense heat, smells and colours of this beautiful coastline.
