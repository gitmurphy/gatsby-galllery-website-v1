maeveobyrne.com

Website built for artist Maeve O'Byrne based in County Wexford Ireland. Maeve wished to display her work to an international audience. This website is to be the a baseline from which to build a larger content base in future and subsequently more complex systems may need to be included such as databases and image hosting solutions. 

This website is intended to be built in a way that allows the addition of a CMS system and analytics systems in future deployments. For this reason the website is built with Gatsby and hosted on Netlify so as to avail of Netlify CMS at a later date.
